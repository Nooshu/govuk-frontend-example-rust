# Example service

**Apply for a rod fishing licence** is the reference GOV.UK service in this repository. It is an example. It does not take payment, send email, or issue a licence.

Every HTML page shows an **Important** notification banner (“This is a live demo. It is not a real government service.”), styled yellow via `.app-demo-banner` so it stands out from the blue header/footer, and a phase banner that repeats that it is a demonstration.

Search engines must not index this example:

- every HTML page includes `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nosnippet, noimageindex">`
- every HTTP response (HTML, assets, health, robots.txt, fixture fragments) sends `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nosnippet, noimageindex`
- `/robots.txt` disallows all paths for `*` and major crawlers (no sitemap)

Pages are **Rust** (Axum + Askama). Component HTML comes from **native Rust renderers** that track GOV.UK Frontend macros and match every official fixture. The pin is **6.5.1**. See [tech-stack.md](tech-stack.md).

## Run it

```sh
npm ci
npm start
```

Opens at <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (server listens on all interfaces by default; use `HOST=127.0.0.1` to bind loopback only). Set `PORT` to use another port.

Public demo hosting: [deploying-on-render.md](deploying-on-render.md).

`NODE_ENV=production` hides the component catalogue and the extra example pages unless `DEMOS_ENABLED=true` (set on the Render demo). The licence journey stays available.

## Start to confirmation

The journey is one service, from the start page through to confirmation.

1. Start at `/` (English) or `/cy` (Welsh start page only). Choose **Start now**.
2. The task list at `/task-list` links to each question.
3. Answer the questions in order: name, date of birth, email, contact preference, where you will fish, licence length, start month, address, evidence (optional), additional details (optional), and password.
4. Check your answers at `/check-answers`. Change links return to a question and then come back.
5. Submit. The confirmation page at `/confirmation` shows a reference. The password is not shown.

Invalid answers stay on the same question, with an error summary and the values you entered. You cannot open confirmation until the required questions are complete.

| `/components`                        | **Component catalogue** — every component in this Frontend release as **links only** (no embedded demos)                                        |
| `/components/:name`                  | One component’s page: Rust-rendered HTML for a fixture, with a banner saying whether it matches the official fixture                            |
| `/components/:name?fixture=`         | A named fixture on that component page                                                                                                          |

Question pages use one `h1`, `novalidate`, an error summary, and field errors. Answers are kept when validation fails. A page uses a back link or breadcrumbs, not both.

## Responses

Pages and assets use the shared [baseline](frontend-security.md). Public HTML that sets the session cookie is `private, no-cache`, with a strong `ETag`. Question, task list, check your answers, confirmation, and cookie settings pages are `no-store`. The compiled Sass stylesheet (`application.css`), Frontend script, and the external `initAll()` module are fingerprinted and cached as immutable. The `js-enabled` snippet is the one line hashed in `baseline/policy.json`.

The server compresses with Brotli when the browser sends `Accept-Encoding: br`. Gzip is only used when the browser does not advertise `br`. Local `npm start` is HTTP, so the session cookie is not `Secure` and responses do not send HSTS.

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

This runs the shared baseline suite and the Sass pipeline tests at **100%** line, branch, and function coverage, compiles the stylesheet, then runs `cargo test --all`. Application packages are held to **100%** function, branch, and statement coverage where gated. The process entry (`main`) may be excluded.

Component tests render **every** official fixture shipped with the pinned `govuk-frontend` release, including hidden fixtures. The comparison is Rust `render` output against the fixture's `html` string. The renderer trims only the outer whitespace of its own output so that output can equal the fixture. Tests do not edit fixture HTML and do not normalise it before comparing.

## Limits

- Sessions are stored in memory and end when the process stops.
- The password is checked and then discarded. It is not stored or shown again.
- A cookie choice is stored. This example does not set analytics cookies.
- An upload stores the file name only, and only for PDF, PNG, or JPG.
- Using this repo does not make a service assessment-ready. See [service-assessment-readiness.md](service-assessment-readiness.md).
